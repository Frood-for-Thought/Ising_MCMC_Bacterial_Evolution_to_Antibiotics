# Ising_MCMC_Bacterial_Evolution_to_Antibiotics
A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Ising Model for Bacterial Evolution. Using the mathematical model in ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics called the Ising Model as a basis 
in order to create a new program to simulate how an antibiotic gradient affects the rate of mutation of a bacterial population.
